## About

This project was created for my Multimedia Systems course at SFU.\n
The goal of this project was to:\n
  --- Interpret the WAV file header and use that information to read the following data\n
  --- Capture the raw sound bytes from the wav file and store these bytes into arrays using bit shifting\n
  --- Draw the waveforms onto the screen without using any additional libraries to assist in drawing the waveforms\n

## Features
  --- File Selector
  --- Single and Multichannel file reading
  --- Sample and Frequency Display
